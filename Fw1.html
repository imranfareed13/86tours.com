                </div>Ice cream is a type of frozen dessert that is usually made from milk or cream that has been flavored with fruit, like peaches or strawberries, and a spice, like vanilla or cocoa, or with sugar or a substitute. Stabilizers are sometimes combined with food coloring. The mixture is stirred and cooled below the water's freezing point to introduce air spaces and stop ice crystals from forming. Another way to make it is to whisk liquid nitrogen and a flavor-infused cream base together. The end product is a semi-solid, smooth foam that solidifies at extremely low temperatures (less than 2 °C, or 35 °F). As the temperature rises, it becomes more pliable.

                    <p>You can eat ice cream with a spoon, in dishes, or as finger food by licking it off of edible wafer ice cream cones. Ice cream can be combined with other desserts, like cake or pie, or used as a component of cold recipes, like baked goods like baked Alaska or ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes.</p>
